  <p>In collaboration with Dr Gordon Waiter and the <a href="https://www.sinapse.ac.uk">Scottish Imaging Network: A Platform for Scientific Excellence (SINAPSE)</a>, I am delighted to present our co-production toolkit, titled ‘“The Real PPI” The Researcher’s Toolkit’!</p>
  <h3>What is co-production?</h3>
  <p>Co-production is a collaborative approach to research that emphasises the involvement of both lived and learnt experience, with the aims of conducting increasingly effective research that is more applicable and impactful to members of the lived experience community.</p>
  
  <h3>What led to development of this toolkit?</h3>
  <p>As part of the SINAPSE 2025 ASM and with assistance from The University of Aberdeen Alzheimer’s Research UK (ARUK) and the Eating Disorders and Autism Collaborative (EDAC), Dr Sader and Dr Waiter organised a day-long workshop focusing on research co- production and co-design, titled: ‘Co-production in Research: “The Real PPI”’. The workshop gathered systematic feedback from various lived- and learnt-experience stakeholders and attendees, and directly informed the creation of this 35-page co-production toolkit.</p>

  <h3>What does the toolkit aim to provide?</h3>
<p>The Researcher’s Toolkit consolidates best practice guidance on co-producing research forresearchers and stakeholders. The toolkit aims to enhance the robustness and rigour ofpractice for researchers at all career stages and across all disciplines to improve their participatory research practice. </p>

  <p>'About the Brain', designed in collaboration with the <a href="https://peacepathway.org/">PEACE Pathway</a>, explains how brain scans can help us understand the connection between autism and eating disorders. Learn about the latest research and how these insights could improve treatment. </p>

  <p> Tired of trying to understand (or communicate) scientific jargon? Take a look at a research terminology index I made for EDAC, which is a 10-page resource defining important key words or approaches used in the research landscape. </p>
