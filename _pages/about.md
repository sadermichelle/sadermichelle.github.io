I am a postdoctoral research fellow in **translational neuroscience**, driven by a fascination with the brain as one of the most complex and remarkable systems we know. My research combines neuroimaging, data analysis, and psychology to explore how brain structure and function support emotion, appetite, and behaviour across both typical and clinical populations, with a particular focus on eating disorders, autism, and **avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)**.

I completed my **PhD** in Translational Neuroscience at the University of Aberdeen, where I used advanced neuroimaging methods to investigate emotional and appetitive regulation in eating disorders. I previously obtained a **BSc (Hons; 1:1)** in Neuroscience with Psychology, also at the University of Aberdeen, where I was awarded the Stewart Bourner Prize for my dissertation working on Field-Cycling Imaging (FCI) MRI approaches. These experiences shaped my interest in translational, data-driven research that bridges brain, behaviour, and clinical relevance.

Central to my work is a commitment to ethical, impactful, and co-produced research. Through my role in the UKRI-funded **Eating Disorders and Autism Collaborative (EDAC)**, I aim to collaborate closely with individuals with lived experience, clinicians, and researchers to ensure that research is inclusive, meaningful, and capable of changing lives. My own previous lived experience with diagnoses of mental health conditions and eating disorders are fundamental to who I am as a person and as a researcher.
