  <h2>Dr. Michelle Sader; ARFID and the Brain</h2>
  <p>What is ARFID? Are there structural differences in the brains of children with ARFID symptoms? Does autism and ARFID share neuroanatomical similarities? </p>


<p> All this and more answered as Dr. Clara Faria kindly interviews me about my research into brain differences in children who show symptoms of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) on 'Mind the Kids': an ACAMH podcast.</p>

  <h2>ACAMH Learn: Neural Correlates of Children with Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) Symptoms</h2>
  <p>In this video abstract, Dr. Michelle Sader discusses her co-authored JCPP paper ‘Neural correlates of children with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder symptoms: large-scale neuroanatomical analysis of a paediatric population’. Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a recently recognised feeding and eating disorder and is characterised by a lack of interest and motivation to eat. Despite burgeoning research, few studies to date have explored the underlying neurobiology of ARFID. Research examining the neural underpinnings of ARFID can greatly assist in understanding different mechanisms that play disorder-specific roles.</p>
    
<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<p><i>1. An overview of ARFID and existing neuroimaging research on ARFID.</i></p>
<p><i>2. Determine whether altered brain morphology is associated with ARFID symptomatology.</i></p>
<p><i>3. Evaluate and compare brain morphology in children with and without ARFID.</i></p>
