excerpt: '**Abstract:** Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a relatively new feeding and eating disorder (FED), categorised in May 2013 within the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). ARFID is characterised by extreme restriction in dietary intake, to the point where an individual’s nutritional intake, weight/growth, and psychological/social functioning are negatively impacted. Due to the novelty of this FED, much is unknown about ARFID with limited investigation provided on disorders-related causes, symptom presentation, treatment and outcome. Widespread research and validation of standardised tools for disorder identification and recovery are highly warranted to further clinician, researcher and public understanding of ARFID.'
