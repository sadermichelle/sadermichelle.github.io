excerpt: '<i>**Abstract**</i> <br> 
<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a relatively new feeding and eating disorder category in DSM-5 characterized by extreme food avoidance/restriction. Much is unknown about ARFID, with limited understanding of its prevalence and comorbidities in general pediatric populations. This study aimed to classify ARFID prevalence and characteristics in children within the Generation R Study, a population-based Dutch cohort (N = 2,862).<br>
<br>
<b>Method:</b> ARFID was assessed via an Index that comprised parent-reported questionnaires and researcher-assessed measures of picky eating, energy intake, diet quality, growth, and psychosocial impact, all in the absence of body/weight dissatisfaction to align with DSM-5 criteria. Parents also reported on child appetitive traits and emotional/behavioral problems (eg, anxiety, depression, attention problems).<br>
<br>
<b>Results:</b> Using DSM-5–based categorization, 183 (6.4%) of 2,862 children were classified as presenting with ARFID symptoms. Compared with children not exhibiting symptoms, children classified with ARFID symptomatology expressed other avoidant eating behavior, including decreased enjoyment of food (d = −1.06, false discovery rate–corrected p [pFDR] < .001), increased satiety responsiveness (d = 1.06, pFDR < .001), and emotional undereating (d = 0.21, pFDR < .01), as well as more emotional problems, including withdrawn/depressed (d = 0.38, pFDR < .001), social problems (d = 0.34, pFDR < 0.001), attention problems (d = 0.38, pFDR < .001), anxiety (d = 0.30, pFDR < .001), obsessive/compulsive problems (d = 0.15, pFDR < .05), and autistic traits (d = 0.22; pFDR < .05). Associations did not differ by sex. <br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first large-scale community-based study to characterize ARFID and to demonstrate that ARFID symptom classification is common in children aged ≤10 years. Findings suggest that appetitive, emotional, and behavioral comorbidities may underlie or reinforce the presentation of ARFID. <br>
