excerpt: '<i>__Abstract__</i> <br>
<br> EDAC (Eating Disorders and Autism Collaborative) is an innovative project aiming to increase research capacity by supporting collaboration in the fields of eating disorders and autism. EDAC comprises four integrated workstreams to co-produce interdisciplinary research, directed by Autistic individuals with lived experience of eating disorders. Workstream 1 will outline best collaborative practices, informing the research network. Workstream 2 will use arts-based methodologies to set research priorities, with emphasis on the perspectives of underrepresented groups. Workstream 3 will support interdisciplinary collaborations to develop innovative research. Finally, workstream 4 will maximise knowledge mobilisation with the aim of reducing barriers to rapid incorporation of research into policy and clinical practice. A core aim of EDAC is to embed a neurodiversity-affirming culture within eating disorder research and to support the development of a new generation of researchers conducting innovative and meaningful research with the potential to improve clinical outcomes.<br>
