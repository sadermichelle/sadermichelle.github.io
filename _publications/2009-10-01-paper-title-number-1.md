excerpt: '**Abstract** <br>
<br>
Recent research reports Anorexia Nervosa (AN) to be highly dependent upon
neurobiological function. Some behaviours, particularly concerning food
selectivity are found in populations with both Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) and AN, and there is a proportionally elevated number of anorexic
patients exhibiting symptoms of ASD. We performed a systematic review of
structural MRI literature with the aim of identifying common structural
neural correlates common to both AN and ASD. Across 46 ASD publications, a
meta‐analysis of volumetric differences between ASD and healthy controls
revealed no consistently affected brain regions. Meta‐analysis of 23 AN pub-
lications revealed increased volume within the orbitofrontal cortex and medial
temporal lobe, and adult‐only AN literature revealed differences within the
genu of the anterior cingulate cortex. The changes are consistent with alter-
ations in flexible reward‐related learning and episodic memory reported in
neuropsychological studies. There was no structural overlap between ASD and
AN. Findings suggest no consistent neuroanatomical abnormality associated
with ASD, and evidence is lacking to suggest that reported behavioural sim-
ilarities between those with AN and ASD are due to neuroanatomical struc-
tural similarities.<br>
