excerpt: '*Abstract:* Objective: Dysregulated appetite control is characteristic of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and obesity (OB). Studies using a broad range of methods suggest the cerebellum plays an important role in aspects of weight and appetite control, and is implicated in both AN and OB by reports of aberrant gray matter volume (GMV) compared to nonclinical populations. As functions of the cerebellum are anatomically segregated, specific localization of aberrant anatomy may indicate the mechanisms of its relationship with weight and appetite in different states. We sought to determine if there were consistencies in regions of cerebellar GMV changes in AN/BN and OB, as well as across normative (NOR) variation.
Method: Systematic review and meta-analysis using GingerALE.
Results: Twenty-six publications were identified as either case-control studies (nOB = 277; nAN/BN = 510) or regressed weight from NOR data against brain volume (total n = 3830). AN/BN and OB analyses both showed consistently decreased GMV within Crus I and Lobule VI, but volume reduction was bilateral for AN/BN and unilateral for OB. Analysis of the NOR data set identified a cluster in right posterior lobe that overlapped with AN/BN cerebellar reduction. Sensitivity analyses indicated robust repeatability for NOR and AN/BN cohorts, but found OB-specific heterogeneity.
Discussion: Findings suggest that more than one area of the cerebellum is involved in control of eating behavior and may be differentially affected in normal variation and pathological conditions. Specifically, we hypothesize an association with sensorimotor and emotional learning via Lobule VI in AN/BN, and executive function via Crus I in OB.'
