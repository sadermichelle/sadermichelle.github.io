A day-long workshop focusing on how to incorporate co-production in research.

What is Co-Production?
======
Co-production is a collaborative approach to research that emphasises the involvement of
both lived and learnt experience, with the aims of conducting increasingly effective research
that is more applicable and impactful to members of the lived experience community. <br>

What led to development of this toolkit?
======
As part of the SINAPSE 2025 ASM and with assistance from The University of Aberdeen Alzheimer’s Research UK (ARUK), Eating Disorders and Autism Collaborative (EDAC), Dr Michelle Sader and Dr Gordon Waiter organised
a day-long workshop focusing on research co- production and co-design, titled: ‘Co-production in Research: “The Real PPI”’. The workshop gathered systematic feedback from various lived- and learnt-experience
stakeholders and attendees, and directly informed the creation of this 35-page co-production toolkit.<br>

What does the toolkit aim to provide?
=====
The Researcher’s Toolkit consolidates best practice guidance on co-producing research for
researchers and stakeholders. The toolkit aims to enhance the robustness and rigour of
practice for researchers at all career stages and across all disciplines to improve their
participatory research practice.
